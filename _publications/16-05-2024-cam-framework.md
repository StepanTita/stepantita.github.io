title: "Is context attribution all you need to attain generalizability in non-fine-tuned transformer? A Framework for Fake News Detection in Cross dataset Evaluation Settings"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/14-02-2024-space-model
excerpt: 'We propose a novel method of context attribution for the transformer model that proves to be more efficient and generalizable. We show that in an example of a fake news detection task, utilizing three distinct datasets and outperforming the baseline model in both the same dataset and cross-dataset zero-shot test.'
