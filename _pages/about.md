Hello there! 👋 I'm Stepan, a highly motivated professional with a strong background in Machine Learning, Computer Science, and Data Science. 

Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Fordham University, I am deeply engaged in cutting-edge research as a Graduate Research Assistant. My focus lies in developing a Neural Framework for Discovering Spurious Components in LLM Decisions, employing innovative methods for LLM-generated representations using a Sandbox network.
